My third-year project. A BSL dictionary app for kids. Developed for Android.  
  
Currently, almost finished implementing all mandatory functional requirements. Account system and multiple video support are all that's left. Also, security.  
After that, have a go at implementing tagging system (w/ improved browsing of words/phrases), improve GUI (currently very barebones), migrate from XAMPP to web server, record videos in app.  
If time allows, attempt some form of offline saving (either save just the videos, or the whole word/video page).  
More validation is needed generally.  
User testing is coming up soon.
