My third-year project. A BSL dictionary app for kids. Developed for Android.  
  
Currently, almost finished implementing all mandatory functional requirements. Account system is all that's left. 
After that, have a go at implementing tagging system (w/ improved browsing of words/phrases), improve GUI (currently very barebones), migrate from XAMPP to web server, record videos in app. Also, fix the darn video previews!  
If time allows, attempt some form of offline saving (either save just the videos, or the whole word/video page).  
More validation is needed generally. Log in report (table of cases, etc).  
User testing is coming up soon.
