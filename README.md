My third-year project. A BSL dictionary app for kids. Developed for Android. /n
/n
Currently, almost finished implementing all mandatory functional requirements. Account system and multiple video support are all that's left. Also, security. /n
After that, have a go at implementing tagging system (w/ improved browsing of words/phrases), improve GUI (currently very barebones), migrate from XAMPP to web server, record videos in app. /n
If time allows, attempt some form of offline saving (either save just the videos, or the whole word/video page). /n
More validation is needed generally. /n
User testing is coming up soon. /n
